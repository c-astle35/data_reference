CHALLENGE: 

	Try to bring something new to the table:
	
		+doesn't have to be big (though it can definitely be if you want it to)
			+programming techniques:
				example:
					How to do a list comprehension:
						aList = [x for x in range(1,10,2)]
			+a dataset you thought was interesting
			+a programming technique
			+a statistical technique
			+an interesting library
			+a handy website that you like to use as reference, etc.
			+a book you think is a good read that could help on a project or give ideas; 
			 especially if it's at the intro-level for people unfamiliar with certain concepts
			 	examples:
					-math
					-stats
					-finance
					-agricultural economics
					-econometrics
					-data science
					-etc.
			#c Please be sure to place the book in a new genre if it doesn't fit in one that's listed below #c
